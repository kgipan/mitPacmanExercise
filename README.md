<h1>MITxPro PacMan Assignment</h1><br>
<h2>Description</h2><br>
<p>This was a week 4 assignment to show control over DOM and highlighting knowledge of:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Two dimensional arrays</li>
    <li>Creating a function for edge detection</li>
    <li>Understanding of booleans (0 is false and positive numbers are true)</li>
    <li>Calling the setTimeout() method</li>
   </ul>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>In the near future I would like to revist this project and add more events to give the user the ability to move PacMan using the up and down keys.</p>
